Preamble
========

??? ### !!!
  (the "Preamble" section is an early draft. what is still missing is
  guidelines for contributors on how to choose licences for their
  contributions, and rules about what can go into the "core" distribution
  and what must be distributed separately, as optional packages)

The licensing of the wxWindows library is intended to protect the wxWindows
library, its developers, and its users, so that the considerable investment
it represents is not abused.

Under the terms of the original wxWindows licences, you as a user are not
obliged to distribute wxWindows source code with your products, if you
distribute these products in binary form. However, you are prevented from
restricting use of the library in source code form, or denying others the
rights to use or distribute wxWindows library source code in the way
intended.

The wxWindows License establishes the copyright for the code and related
material, and it gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the library. It also asserts that no warranty is given by the authors
for this or derived code.

The core distribution of the wxWindows library contains files
under two different licences:

- Most files are distributed under the GNU Library General Public
  License, version 2, with the special exception that you may create and
  distribute object code versions built from the source code or modified
  versions of it (even if these modified versions include code under a
  different licence), and distribute such binaries under your own
  terms.

- Most core wxWindows manuals are made available under the "wxWindows
  Free Documentation License", which allows you to distribute modified
  versions of the manuals, such as versions documenting any modifications
  made by you in your version of the library. However, you may not restrict
  any third party from reincorporating your changes into the original
  manuals.
